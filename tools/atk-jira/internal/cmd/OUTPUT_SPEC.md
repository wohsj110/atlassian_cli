# atk-jira Output Specification

This document is the authoritative declaration of what `atk-jira` output looks like. It covers design principles, output modes, flag semantics, formatting conventions, and the exact output shape for every command in default and extended modes.

## Design principles

1. **Text is the primary format.** Stable `Key: Value` blocks and pipe-delimited tables are parseable without JSON overhead. An agent reading `Status: In Code Review` needs no less capability than one reading `{"status":"In Code Review"}` — and text wins on token density.

2. **Default output is contextually rich, not minimal.** An agent reasoning about an issue needs labels, sprint, parent, points, components — not just key/summary/status. The default output carries the semantic weight required for decision-making without flags.

3. **Administrative detail hides behind `--extended`.** Anything schema-level, rarely-used, or audit-oriented requires the flag. The test: would a developer need this monthly/yearly vs. daily? Monthly/yearly → `--extended`.

4. **JSON is reserved for round-trip payloads.** Only `automation export` emits JSON — it writes directly to stdout, bypassing the global flag system. Every other command produces text.

5. **The tool knows the instance.** A one-time `atk-jira init` plus daily cache refresh lets atk-jira resolve custom fields, users, project types, statuses, link types, and workflow transitions without per-command API calls.

## Output modes

| Mode | Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Default | *(none)* | Contextually-rich human + agent text. Stable format. |
| Extended | `--extended` | Adds admin/schema/audit detail on top of default. Always implies `--fulltext`. |
| Identifier | `--id` | Emits only the primary identifier. Takes precedence over `--extended` and `--fulltext`. |
| Export | implicit on `automation export` | Round-trip JSON for business-rule import/export. |

## Formatting conventions

### List commands: pipe-delimited tables

- Headers in ALL_CAPS
- Separator: ` | ` (space-pipe-space)
- Empty/null values: `-`
- `--extended` adds columns; it does not replace default columns
- Sorted most-recent-first where time-ordered (sprints, etc.)

### Get / single-entity commands: header + key-value block

- First line: `ID  Name` (two spaces between)
- Attribute lines: `Key: Value   Key: Value` (three spaces between same-line pairs)
- Optional rows (Labels, Components) appear only when non-empty
- Description: blank line → `Description:` label → body text, always last

### Date formatting

- Default: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Extended: full ISO 8601 with timezone (`2026-04-16T07:16:24+0000`)
- Missing/not-yet-set: `-`

### Text truncation

- Descriptions and comment bodies truncate in default mode
- Truncation trailer: `[truncated — use --fulltext for complete body]`
- `--fulltext` disables truncation; `--extended` implies `--fulltext`

### Mutations: post-state output

A mutation's success output mirrors the `get` output of the affected entity. The caller sees the post-state in a single call — no follow-up fetch required.

- After create: atk-jira always re-fetches (the Jira API returns incomplete data from the create response)
- Delete / archive / remove: confirmation line only (`Deleted MON-4820`, `Archived MON-4820`)
- `--id` on any mutation: only the affected entity's identifier

### Extended mode additions

Extended consistently adds across command types:
- Raw IDs alongside human-readable names (account IDs, component IDs, sprint IDs, type IDs)
- Full ISO 8601 timestamps instead of `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Admin fields: watchers, resolution, fix versions, status category, all non-null custom fields
- Available workflow transitions (on issue get)

### Error output

Plain prose to stderr. No structured format. Ambiguity errors list all matches. Unknown-entity errors suggest `atk-jira refresh <resource>`.

### Pagination

Paginated list commands append a continuation line when more results exist:

```
More results available (next: eyJzdGFydEF0IjoxMH0)
```

The token is passed back to fetch the next page:

```
$ atk-jira issues list -p MON --next-page-token eyJzdGFydEF0IjoxMH0
```

Absence of the continuation line signals a complete result set.

### Name/ID resolution

All entity-reference flags (`--assignee`, `--project`, `--board`, `--sprint`, link type arguments) resolve via instance cache:

- Unique match (by name, email, key, or ID) → resolve silently
- Ambiguous → fail, listing all matches with identifiers
- No match + looks like a raw ID → pass through unchanged
- No match + looks like a name → fail with suggestion to `atk-jira refresh <resource>`

```
$ atk-jira issues assign MON-4820 "John Smith"
Ambiguous user "John Smith" — 3 matches:
  5a1b2c... | John Smith | john.smith@ibm.com
  6d3e4f... | John Smith | jsmith@ibm.com
  7g8h9i... | John A. Smith | jasmith@ibm.com
Use account ID or email to disambiguate.
```

```
$ atk-jira issues assign MON-4820 "Zzznonexistent"
Unknown user "Zzznonexistent" — not found in cache. Try `atk-jira refresh users` if this user was recently added.
```

```

Extended always implies `--fulltext`. Adds: reporter with ID, raw timestamps with timezone, status category, sprint dates and ID, component IDs, watchers, resolution, fix versions (even when empty), all non-null custom fields (by name and ID), and available transitions.

**`issues history MON-4810`** — default:
```
ID | CREATED | AUTHOR | FIELD | FROM | TO
113344 | 2026-04-16 | Aaron Wong | status | Backlog | Ready for Development
113345 | 2026-04-16 | Aaron Wong | assignee | - | Rian Stockbower
113346 | 2026-04-17 | Rian Stockbower | summary | Initial placeholder | Audit and remediate accessibility issues on CapOne-specific surfaces
More results available (next: 50)
```

Rows are chronological in Jira's changelog order. Each row is one changed field item. The `ID` is the changelog group ID and may repeat when Jira groups multiple field changes in one history entry.

**`issues history MON-4810 --id`:**
```
113344
113345
113346
More results available (next: 50)
```

**`issues history MON-4810 --extended`:**
```
ID | CREATED | AUTHOR | ACCOUNT_ID | FIELD | FIELD_ID | TYPE | FROM_ID | FROM | TO_ID | TO
113344 | 2026-04-16T07:05:10.000+0000 | Aaron Wong | 5f3a21... | status | status | jira | 10000 | Backlog | 10001 | Ready for Development

```

`--id` emits one changelog group ID per history group, not one ID per flattened item row. `--fields` projects fixed history columns and prepends `ID` when omitted. Extended-only columns such as `ACCOUNT_ID`, `FIELD_ID`, `TYPE`, `FROM_ID`, and `TO_ID` require `--extended`.

**`issues fields MON-4810`** — default:
```
FIELD_ID | NAME | TYPE | VALUE
summary | Summary | string | Audit and remediate accessibility issues on CapOne-specific surfaces
status | Status | status | In Code Review
assignee | Assignee | user | Aaron Wong
customfield_10035 | Story Points | number | 5
customfield_10050 | Team | option | Platform
...
```

**`issues fields MON-4810 --custom-fields`:** filters to `customfield_*` rows only.

**`issues types MON`** — default:
```

123 | closed | 2026-03-13 | 2026-03-27 | MON Sprint 68
```

Sorted most-recent-first. Dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

**`sprints list --board 23 --extended`:**
```

```

**`sprints current --board 23`** — default:
```
125  MON Sprint 70
State: active   Start: 2026-04-10   End: 2026-04-24
Board: 23 (MON board)
```

**`sprints current --board 23 --extended`:**

Origin Board: 23
```

**`sprints issues 125`** — same shape as `issues list`. `--extended` matches `issues list --extended`.

### `comments`

**`comments list MON-4810`** — default:
```
ID | AUTHOR | CREATED | BODY
21242 | Aaron Wong | 2026-04-16 | Short audit conclusion after the current code changes: The major source-level accessibility findings on CapOne-specific surfaces appear to be addressed or materially improv...
```

**`comments list MON-4810 --fulltext`:** one block per comment:
```

```

**`comments list MON-4810 --extended`:**

```

### `links`

**`links list MON-4818`** — default:
```
LINK_ID | TYPE | DIRECTION | ISSUE | SUMMARY
17844 | Blocker | blocks | MON-4819 | Linked issue B
17845 | Relates | relates to | MON-4700 | Fix ghost row in data table
```

**`links list MON-4818 --extended`:**
```
LINK_ID | TYPE_ID | TYPE | DIRECTION | ISSUE | STATUS | SUMMARY
17844 | 10100 | Blocker | blocks | MON-4819 | Backlog | Linked issue B
17845 | 10200 | Relates | relates to | MON-4700 | Deployed | Fix ghost row in data table
```

Extended adds the link type ID and the linked issue's current status.

**`links types`** — default:
```
ID | NAME | INWARD | OUTWARD
10100 | Blocker | is blocked by | blocks
10200 | Relates | relates to | relates to
10300 | Cloners | is cloned by | clones
10400 | Duplicate | is duplicated by | duplicates
```

Cached during init/refresh. `links create` accepts the type name ("Blocker"), the outward verb ("blocks"), or the inward verb ("is blocked by").

### `remotelinks`

Remote (web) links are external URLs attached to an issue and shown in the Jira links sidebar — distinct from `links`, which connect two Jira issues.

**`remotelinks list MON-4818`** — default:
```
ID | TITLE | URL
10001 | GitHub #456: Some issue | https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456
10002 | Design doc | https://example.com/design
```

**`remotelinks list MON-4818 --extended`:**
```
ID | RELATIONSHIP | TITLE | URL | SUMMARY
10001 | mentioned in | GitHub #456: Some issue | https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456 | Tracks the upstream fix
10002 | - | Design doc | https://example.com/design | -
```

Extended adds the relationship label and the link summary.

**`remotelinks add MON-4818 --url ... --title ...`** — post-state detail:
```
Added remote link 10001 to MON-4818
ID: 10001
Issue: MON-4818
Title: GitHub #456: Some issue
URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/456
```

`--title` defaults to the URL when omitted. `--id` emits only the new link ID.

**`remotelinks delete MON-4818 10001`** — confirmation line only:
```
Deleted remote link 10001 from MON-4818
```

### `transitions`

**`transitions list MON-4810`** — default:
```

**`automation get <id> --show-components`:** dumps the full component tree as indented text (trigger → conditions → actions).

**`automation export <id>`:** emits the rule definition as pretty-printed JSON to stdout. This is the round-trip format consumed by `automation create --from-file`. `--compact` minifies. This command bypasses the global flag system.

### `dashboards`

**`dashboards list`** — default:

### `fields`

**`fields list`** — default:
```
ID | TYPE | NAME
summary | string | Summary
status | status | Status
customfield_10035 | number | Story Points
customfield_10050 | option | Team
customfield_10020 | array | Sprint
```

**`fields list --custom-fields`:** filters to `customfield_*` rows only.

**`fields list --name story`:** substring filter on name.

**`fields list --extended`:**
```
ID | TYPE | SEARCHABLE | NAVIGABLE | ORDERABLE | CLAUSE_NAMES | NAME
summary | string | yes | yes | yes | summary | Summary
status | status | yes | yes | no | status | Status
customfield_10035 | number | yes | yes | yes | cf[10035], Story Points | Story Points
customfield_10050 | option | yes | yes | yes | cf[10050], Team[Dropdown], Team | Team
customfield_10020 | array | yes | yes | yes | cf[10020], Sprint | Sprint
```

**`fields show customfield_10050`** — flat denormalized view:
```
CONTEXT_ID | CONTEXT | PROJECTS | OPTION_ID | OPTION_VALUE
10100 | Default Context | (global) | 20001 | Platform
10100 | Default Context | (global) | 20002 | Integration
10100 | Default Context | (global) | 20003 | Frontend
10101 | MON Project Context | MON | 20010 | CapOne
10101 | MON Project Context | MON | 20011 | Acme
10102 | ON Project Context | ON | - | -
```

Empty contexts render with `- | -` so the context is discoverable.

## Command outputs — mutations

**General rule: a mutation's success output mirrors the `get` output of the affected entity.** The caller sees the post-state in a single call without a follow-up fetch. `--id` on any mutation emits only the affected entity's identifier.

### `issues create / update / assign / transition / archive`

```
$ atk-jira issues create -p MON --type SDLC --summary "Fix ghost row"
MON-4820  Fix ghost row
Status: Backlog   Type: SDLC   Priority: Medium   Points: -

```

### `issues delete`

```
$ atk-jira issues delete MON-4820
Deleted MON-4820
```

Multi-delete: one line per deleted issue.

### `comments add / delete`

```
$ atk-jira comments add MON-4810 "Noting that this needs QA review on Safari 16."
MON-4810 #21276 — Rian Stockbower, 2026-04-16

```

### `links create / delete`

```
$ atk-jira links create MON-4819 Blocker MON-4818
17844 | Blocker | blocks | MON-4818
```

Accepts link type by name ("Blocker"), outward verb ("blocks"), or inward verb ("is blocked by"). After create, atk-jira re-queries to recover the link ID (the Jira API does not return it from the create call).

```
$ atk-jira links delete 17844
Deleted link 17844
```

### `projects create / update / delete / restore`

```
$ atk-jira projects create --key GFIL --name "Gap Fill" --type software --lead rian@monitapp.io
GFIL  Gap Fill
Type: software   Lead: Rian Stockbower   Style: next-gen
Issue Types: Task, Sub-task
Components: 0   Versions: 0
```

After create, atk-jira re-fetches to get the fully-populated project.

```
$ atk-jira projects delete GFIL
Deleted project GFIL (moved to trash — recoverable for 60 days via `projects restore`)
```

```
$ atk-jira projects restore GFIL
GFIL  Gap Fill Automation
Type: software   Lead: Rian Stockbower   Style: next-gen

### `attachments add / delete`

```
$ atk-jira attachments add MON-4810 ./audit-notes.md
10236 | audit-notes.md | 4.2 KB | Rian Stockbower | 2026-04-16

Deleted dashboard 10073
```

### `automation create / enable / disable / update / delete`
