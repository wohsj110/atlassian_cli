// Package keyring is atlassian-agent-cli's credential adapter: a thin wrapper
// over cli-common's credstore (OS keyring — macOS Keychain, Linux Secret
// Service, Windows Credential Manager, or an opt-in encrypted-file
// backend). It is the single chokepoint through which both atk-cfl and atk-jira
// store and read the Atlassian API token (the access secret). Non-secret
// configuration (url, email, auth_method, cloud_id, per-tool defaults)
// stays in the plaintext shared config file owned by package credstore.
//
// This package is pure library: it must not import cobra. The
// set-credential logic lives here as a plain function; each tool registers
// its own thin cobra wrapper.

// The Atlassian token bundle lives under one fixed, shared ref so atk-cfl and
// atk-jira collapse onto the same keyring entry (a token migrated by whichever
// binary runs first is seen as already-migrated by the other). The ref is
// a compile-time constant — there is no credential_ref config field.
